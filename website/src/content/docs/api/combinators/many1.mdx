title: many1
---

Accepts a single parser, which must match at least once or infinite times otherwise it fails.

:::info
Available since: `v1.0.0-alpha.1`
:::

## Type declaration

```ts
const many1: (parser: Parser, name?: string) => Parser;
```

## Example

In this example we are going to parse the string `"Hello"` as many times as possible.

```ts
import { many1, string } from "rudus";

const parser = many1(string("Hello"));

const result = parser.run("");
```

The `result` of the parser above will be:

```json
{
  "input": "",
  "isError": true,
  "offset": 0,
  "result": null,
  "errorMessage": "many1: Failed to match at least once at offset 0"
}
```
